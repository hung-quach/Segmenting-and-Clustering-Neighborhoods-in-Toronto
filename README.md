# Segmenting-and-Clustering-Neighborhoods-in-Toronto

In this project, I did the following main tasks:
1. convert addresses into their equivalent latitude and longitude values
2. Use the Foursquare API to explore neighborhoods in Toronto
3. Use the explore function to get the most common venue categories in each neighborhood, and then use this feature to group the neighborhoods into clusters. 
4. Use the k-means clustering algorithm to complete this task. 
5. Use the Folium library to visualize the neighborhoods in Toronto and their emerging cluster
